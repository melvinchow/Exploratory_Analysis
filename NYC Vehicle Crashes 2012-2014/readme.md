# Motor Vehicle Crashes in NYC

## Finding #1:
Bicycles see more accidents from poor environments, while motorcycles see more accidents from unsafe driving

## Finding #2:
If an accident was made while backing, then the car is more likely to be a suburban than a sedan, but this is NOT true if either driver is driving at an unsafe speed or fails to yield the right-of-way. (unsafe_speed = 1 or failure_to_yield = 1)

## Finding #3:
Vehicle manufacturer Toyota is infamous for accelerator problems in their cars.  However, close competitor Honda also has accelerator problems, with failure rates similar to Toyotas in certain years of manufacture.  Hondas also have a higher rate of power steering failure than Toyotas.
